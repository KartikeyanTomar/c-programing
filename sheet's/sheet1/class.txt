# History of c
1st first step towards c was taken by Dennis Ritchie>
The c language was developed at Bell Labs in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.
it was developed as a system programming language to write 
an operating system called UNIX. 

# Interpreter
Interpreter is a program which is used to execute the program line by line.

# Compiler
Compiler is a program which is used to convert the program into machine code.

# why c is midle level language
C is a midle level language because it is a combination 
of high level language and low level language.




# Structure of c
1. Header files
    # include <stdio.h> are used to include the header files
    other headers are also used like math and string etc.
2. Global variables
    # global variables are declared outside the main functions
    # Value of global variable is zero by default 
    # value of normal variable is zero. 
3. Functions
    # functions are declared outside the main functions
    # functions are used to perform a specific task
    # functions are divided into two types
        1. user defined functions
        2. library functions
    # library functions are predefined functions
    # user defined functions are functions which are defined by the user
4. Main function
    # main function is the starting point of the program
    # main function is the only function which is not called
    # main function is divided into two parts
        1. pre defined part
        2. user defined part
    # pre defined part is the part which is already defined
    # user defined part is the part which is defined by the user
5. sub functions
    # sub functions are functions which are called inside the main function
    # sub functions are divided into two types
        1. void functions
        2. non void functions
    # void functions are functions which do not return any value
    # non void functions are functions which return a value


# variables
1. local variables
    # local variables are declared inside the functions
    # local variables are divided into two types
        1. auto variables
        2. register variables
2. Global variables
    # global variables are declared outside the functions
    # global variables are divided into two types
        1. static variables
        2. external variables

# Identifires
1. Identifires are the names which are used to define the variables, functions, 
   arrays etc.



# Keywords

# What are keywords?
1. Keywords are the reserved words which are used to perform a specific task.
2. Keywords are divided into two types
    1. Data type keywords
    2. Storage class keywords
3. Data type keywords are used to define the data type of the variable.
4. Storage class keywords are used to define the storage class of the variable.

5. key words can not be variable name 
6. those who have (paranthesis) at the end are function not keywords
7. we have total 32 keywords in c language
         

# datatype
1. basis
    1. int
        1. short int - 2 bytes
            --signed
            --unsigned
        2. int - 4 bytes
        3. long int - 8 bytes
    2. float
    3. char
        1. signed -range is -128 to 127
            formula  -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1 
        2. unsigned -range is 0 to 255
            formula  0 to 2^n-1
    4. double
2. void
3. enum
4. derived

# storage classes
1. auto
2. register
3. static
4. extern
